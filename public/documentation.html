    <h1>80's Flixs API</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this app is to gain experience building the server-side
      component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide
      users with access to information about different movies, directors, and
      genres. Users will be able to sign up,update their personal information,
      and create a list of their favorite movies. I have chosen to narrow the
      focus of the "movies" web application to movies created in the 1980's.
